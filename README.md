Weather Data ETL Dashboard

This project simulates a real-world ETL pipeline for collecting and analyzing weather data. Using Python, I pull current weather data for multiple U.S. cities from the OpenWeatherMap API, transform and clean the data, and store it in a SQL Server database. Each ETL run logs its results (successes/failures), and the data is visualized in Power BI using dynamic dashboards with city filters, temperature/humidity trends, and KPI summaries.

Tools used: Python, SQL Server, Power BI, REST API (JSON), pyodbc, Pandas

Key features:

Robust error handling and logging table

Dashboard with slicers, time-series charts, and weather descriptions

Future expansion planned for scheduling and trend analysis

This project helped me develop skills in ETL pipeline design, API data handling, relational databases, and professional data visualization.
